### `npm run test`
### Test based on `@testing-library/react`

[React Testing Library Github Repository](https://github.com/testing-library/react-testing-library).

React Testing Library helps you to querying the DOM in the same way the user would

I've discovered some days ago this library but I really like this library. Some features about this library?

- Is a replacement for enzyme
- Works with Jest Test Runner
- Works with DOM nodes specifically
- Get a quick overview watching [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmVBCpefQe8)

Some tips to start with RTL:
- Use the [ARIA markup](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/ARIA_Techniques) to find any element in the DOM. Also the app will improve accessibility.
- Use [Testing Playground extension extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/testing-playground/hejbmebodbijjdhflfknehhcgaklhano?hl=en) to build your queries
