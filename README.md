# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts



### `npm start`



### `npm test`



### `npm run build`

## Redux structure:
I would put inputContent inside the component
I prefer pass it to the reducer to see an example of middleware
